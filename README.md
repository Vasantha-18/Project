## Description 
I have designed a Flipkart app clone using Figma as part of a UI/UX design project.
The design includes screens like home, product list, cart, and checkout.
I focused on clean layout, smooth navigation, and consistent UI elements.
Interactive features like buttons and filters were added for a realistic feel.
This project improved my skills in prototyping and user flow design.
